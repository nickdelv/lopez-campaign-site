            These are no ordinary times — for our nation, for our state, and for
            our communities. As a lifelong Democrat, I'm prepared to represent
            and be accountable to all of the District's residents, and to join
            the State House in its fight against the war on immigrants, on
            science, on climate, and on our democratic institutions.

          <p>
            I've been here before. After losing a Select Board race in 2019 by a
            few votes, I doubled down and won the following year — becoming only
            the third woman to serve on Canton's Select Board. I know how to
            fight, how to listen, and how to get things done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Retired from all paid, private sector work, I'm prepared to devote
            myself full time to being the most effective, available, and
            responsive State Representative possible for Canton, Stoughton, and
            Avon.

        <div class="bio-body">
          <p>
            I grew up the oldest of five in a middle-class New Jersey family. My
            father — born in the US to a Puerto Rican mother and Mexican father
            — and my mother were my role models for community service and love
            of country, even though I never shared their politics.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Yale Law School I came to Massachusetts, raised my three
            children here, and never left. For nearly 25 years I was the only
            woman on the executive team at Haemonetics, helping build a global
            business that improved the lives of surgical and cancer patients. It
            was hard. It was thrilling. And it taught me that you get more done
            through persistence, collaboration, and showing up every single day.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's the same approach I've brought to every role in this
            community — and the same approach I'll bring to Beacon Hill.
