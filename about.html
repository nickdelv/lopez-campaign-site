            Lisa grew up the oldest of five children in a middle-class family in
            New Jersey. Her father — born in the United States, the only child
            of a Puerto Rican mother and a Mexican father who himself had 16
            siblings — was a traditional Hispanic husband and father. Her
            parents instilled in her a deep sense of civic responsibility and
            love of country that has shaped everything she has done since.
          </p>
          <p>
            She attended <strong>The Ohio State University</strong> for her
            undergraduate education — a decision that came with its own lesson.
            Her first-choice school, the University of Michigan, had raised its
            tuition by $500 between the time she applied and the time she was
            accepted. Ohio State it was. It was the kind of practical constraint
            that millions of families navigate, and it left its mark.
          </p>
          <p>
            From Ohio State, Lisa went on to earn her law degree from
            <strong>Yale Law School</strong>, one of the most selective
            institutions in the country. After graduating, she relocated to
            Massachusetts — where she has lived, worked, and raised her three
            children ever since.

          Building something<br /><em>that matters</em>
        </h2>
        <div class="prose">
          <p>
            After years at a downtown Boston law firm, Lisa joined one of her
            clients — a privately held medical device company based in
            Braintree. It turned out to be one of the defining decisions of her
            professional life.
          </p>
          <p>
            For nearly <strong>25 years</strong>, she served as an executive and
            chief legal officer at <strong>Haemonetics Corporation</strong>, a
            global medical device company whose products improve outcomes for
            surgical and cancer patients around the world. She held
            responsibilities far beyond legal — including human resources,
            employee health and safety, clinical and regulatory affairs,
            investor relations, external affairs, and internal audit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout that time, she was the
            <strong>only woman on the executive team</strong>. She helped build
            a business from a small privately owned company into a NYSE publicly
            traded global operation. It was thrilling, demanding work — and it
            taught her that results come from persistence, collaboration, and
            showing up every single day.

            <p>
              Lisa's commitment to Canton didn't begin when she decided to run
              for office. It began decades earlier, quietly, through the kinds
              of sustained civic engagement that rarely makes headlines but
              shapes communities over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              She has served in her parish, championed the
              <strong>Community Preservation Act</strong> and chaired the
              initial committee for many years, and worked tirelessly to bring
              the <strong>Paul Revere Heritage Site</strong> to life using CPA
              funds. When the community needed a new pool, she threw herself
              into the campaign to fund it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Immediately after Donald Trump's first election, she volunteered
              as a <strong>pro bono immigration attorney</strong> — putting her
              Yale law degree in service of the most vulnerable residents in her
              community. She has served as a trustee for
              <strong>Cathedral High School</strong>, a Boston school serving
              mostly first-generation college-bound urban youth.

              In 2019, Lisa ran for Canton's Select Board and lost — by a
              handful of votes. Most people would have walked away. She doubled
              down.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following year she ran again, and won — becoming only the
              <strong style="color: #fff">third woman in history</strong> to
              serve on Canton's Select Board. During her tenure she championed

              (Canton Electrical Choice), delivering cleaner and cheaper energy

              address housing instability among seniors, veterans, disabled
              adults, and young families.

              During the COVID years she collaborated with the Department of

            commitment to becoming the most effective, available, and responsive
            State Representative possible for Canton, Stoughton, and Avon.
          </p>
          <p>
            She brings to this race something rare: the legal expertise of a
            Yale-trained attorney, the operational experience of a 25-year
            corporate executive, and the community credibility of someone who
            has shown up for Canton for four decades — through wins and losses
